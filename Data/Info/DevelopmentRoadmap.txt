Here is what needs to get done:

WIP: rewriting the entire code w better design.

--------Next Time--------
-bug fix pInteractor
--------Soon--------
-roll mechanic: lower hp = higher % of success. successful roll = move twice.
-Revamp item notation.
-Revamp treasure system.
-Create a shop system.
-boss battle.
-use threads to check game state.
-game master class that oversees the whole operation
--------Low Priority--------
-Add a shop so that the player can purchase items.
-Randomly generated .txt files that can be completed.
-Procedural generation of .txt files?
-Stair tiles to move up and down dungeons.
-Add more types of equipment.
-add a pre-dungeon inn where the player can rest, speak with locals, buy items.
--------Future Ideas--------
-Consider making numbers on grid larger to have more types of things. Divide
 them by using the space bar as the buffer. First number could indicate type,
 while the second number could indicate type of type.
 -add a save() function which saves the player's data.
 -add a load() function which loads player data.
 -add an actual UI instead of using terminal.
