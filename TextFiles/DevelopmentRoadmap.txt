Here is what needs to get done:

--------Next Time--------
-Revamp treasure system.


--------Soon--------

-boss battle.


--------Low Priority--------
-Randomly generated .txt files that can be completed.
-Procedural generation of .txt files?
-Stair tiles to move up and down dungeons.
-Add more types of equipment.

--------Future Ideas--------
-Consider making numbers on grid larger to have more types of things. Divide
 them by using the space bar as the buffer. First number could indicate type,
 while the second number could indicate type of type.
 -add a save() function which saves the player's data.
 -add a load() function which loads player data.
