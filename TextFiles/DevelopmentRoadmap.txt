Here is what needs to get done:

--------Next Time--------
In game.java:
-add a move(direction) function which changes player location accordingly

--------Soon--------
In game.java:
-add a refresh() function that heals player.
-add a battle() function which starts battle when necessary.
-add a save() function which saves the player's data.
-add a load() function which loads player data.


--------Low Priority--------
-Randomly generated .txt files that can be completed.
-Procedural generation of .txt files?
-Stair tiles to move up and down dungeons.
-Add more types of equipment.
