How this file is meant to work:
-Scan text from left to right.
-When \n is encountered, scan left to right on a new row.
-When number is greater than zero, that turns into a tile.
-Connect the new tile to other nearby tiles (N/E/W/S)
-Set that tile's state to "connected".

Number Notation:
0 - Wall tile.
1 - Start tile.
2 - Walking tile.
3 - Enemy tile.
4 - Treasure tile.
5 - Refresh/Fountain tile.
6 - Boss tile.

Could also make the map randomly generated?
Could also just make a 2x2 array if it won't grow as you play.
