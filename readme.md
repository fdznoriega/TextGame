# Text Adventure Game

## What is it?
This is a text-based adventure game written in Java and designed
with clean architecture/principles. The goal is to a
game which can be implemented in more than one way. Once I
create a console based implementation, a web-based one should be
feasible. Perhaps even a voice only implementation in the future.

## Redesign vs Old Version
The redesign is found in the "clean-redesign" branch, and the
original concept is found in the "master" branch.

## Why design it differently?
After making the original version, I realized that I was headed
in a bad direction. I made a lot of arbitrary commitments. For
example, the previous version had no sense of "tiles" or
"enemies". An enemy space would be randomized instead of given by
the map. I didn't want that, so I went back to the drawing board.

## How do I use it?
This version is currently unusable. It will be implemented into the console first, and then some other place.
The master branch version is usable but is awfully limited. There are instructions on use there.
