----What is this?----
Text-based adventure game that takes inputs through terminal.
Not exactly elegant, but the main intent is to observe how some design
decision might impact future development. Also I'm bored.

----How do I use it?----
Download, then access folder with terminal. In terminal,
Input: javac *.java
Input: java Game
And from there the game will run.
